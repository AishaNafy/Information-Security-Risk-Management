# Elephant House Information Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **information security risk assessment** for **Elephant House**, a leading FMCG brand in Sri Lanka under the **John Keells Group**. Elephant House produces ice creams, beverages, and processed foods, relying heavily on digital systems including ERP, corporate networks, manufacturing control systems, and customer/employee databases. Protecting these information assets is critical to ensure business continuity, maintain data integrity, and comply with regulatory requirements.

The assessment leverages the **OCTAVE Allegro framework**, a structured methodology widely used for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating information security risks. The study focuses on three categories of critical information assets, evaluates potential threats, and proposes practical mitigation strategies.

## Critical Information Assets

### 1. Enterprise Systems & Corporate Network
- **ERP System:** Integrates procurement, manufacturing, HR, finance, and distribution for real-time operations.  
- **Corporate Network:** Connects offices, factories, and warehouses, providing access to ERP, email, and shared resources.  
- **Associated Risks:** Disruption or unauthorized access could halt operations, compromise decision-making, and result in financial loss.

### 2. Servers & Manufacturing Control Systems
- **Servers:** Store sensitive data such as financial records, sales data, supplier contracts, and production schedules.  
- **SCADA/ICS:** Supervisory control systems manage bottling lines, refrigeration, and quality checks to maintain safe and efficient production.  
- **Associated Risks:** System failure or cyberattack could interrupt production, damage equipment, and compromise critical business data.

### 3. Customer & Employee Information
- **Customer Data:** Includes loyalty program information, purchase history, and payment details.  
- **Employee Data:** Payroll, HR, and personal information essential for workforce management.  
- **Associated Risks:** Data breaches could result in legal penalties, financial loss, and reputational damage.
